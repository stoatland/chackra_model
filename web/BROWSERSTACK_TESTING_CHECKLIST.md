## Test Scenarios for Each Device

### 🎵 Audio Functionality

#### Audio Permission Request
- [ ] **Test**: Click "Initialize Audio" button
  - ✅ Should show browser audio permission dialog
  - ✅ Should enable audio controls after permission granted
  - ❌ Record any permission issues or failures

#### Audio Playback
- [ ] **Test**: Start timer and verify audio
  - ✅ Inhale phase: Rising tone (220Hz → 440Hz)
  - ✅ Exhale phase: Falling tone (440Hz → 220Hz)  
  - ✅ Smooth transitions between phases
  - ❌ Record audio glitches, delays, or failures

#### Volume Control
- [ ] **Test**: Volume slider (0-100%)
  - ✅ Volume changes affect audio output
  - ✅ Mute (0%) actually silences audio
  - ✅ Full volume (100%) works without distortion

### 👁️ Visual Functionality 

#### 3D Scene Rendering
- [ ] **Test**: Verify chakra spheres appear
  - ✅ Two spheres visible and properly positioned (touching)
  - ✅ Spheres rotate/move with mouse controls
  - ✅ Scene renders without visual artifacts

#### Chakra Zone Lighting
- [ ] **Test**: Start timer and watch progression
  - ✅ Inhale: Chakras light up 1→7 (bottom to top)
  - ✅ Exhale: Chakras dim 7→1 (top to bottom)
  - ✅ Colors: Red→Orange→Yellow→Green→Blue→Indigo→Violet
  - ✅ Smooth transitions, no abrupt on/off

### ⏱️ Timer Synchronization

#### Audio-Visual Sync
- [ ] **Test**: Critical test for breathing experience
  - ✅ Audio tone rising matches chakra lighting progression
  - ✅ Audio tone falling matches chakra dimming progression
  - ✅ Phase transitions happen simultaneously
  - ⏱️ **Time any delays**: Audio should sync within 50ms of visual

#### Timer Controls
- [ ] **Test**: Start/stop/reset functionality
  - ✅ Start button begins timer and audio/visual
  - ✅ Stop button pauses everything correctly
  - ✅ Reset button returns to initial state

### 📱 Mobile-Specific Tests

#### Touch Controls
- [ ] **Test**: Mobile interaction testing
  - ✅ All buttons respond to touch
  - ✅ 3D scene responds to touch gestures (pinch, pan)
  - ✅ No accidental touches or UI issues

#### Screen Orientation
- [ ] **Test**: Rotate device testing
  - ✅ Portrait mode: UI layout works properly
  - ✅ Landscape mode: UI adapts correctly
  - ✅ Rotation doesn't break audio or visual sync

#### Performance
- [ ] **Test**: Mobile performance assessment
  - ✅ Smooth frame rate (no visible stuttering)
  - ✅ Responsive UI (buttons react quickly)
  - ✅ No browser crashes or freezes
